## Description  

This repository contains all codes used in the manuscript *Observational constraints reveal exacerbated permafrost loss across northern Eurasia*.  
The repository is organized into two main directories: **Process** and **Plot**.  

- **Process/** — data processing scripts  
- **Plot/** — plotting scripts  

---

### Process/  
The **Process** folder includes the complete data processing workflow. It contains:  
- 5 Python scripts  
- 2 Julia scripts  
- 1 NCL script  
- 1 Shell script and the associated TXT input file  

Details of each routine are as follows:  

- **01_Alt_monthly.jl**  
This routine is to calculate the thickness of the active layer (ALT) at each grid cell using raw CMIP6 soil temperature data.  

- **02_CMIP6_EA_pf_area_monthly_masked.ncl**  
This routine is used to calculate permafrost area for each model based on the ALT data generated by the previous routine.  

- **03_Maximum_permafrost_area.py**  
This routine uses ALT outputs from *01_Alt_monthly.jl*, estimating the probability of permafrost occurrence in each grid cell across 18 CMIP6 models.  

- **04_Pf_sensitivity_under_climate_change.py**  
This routine quantifies the sensitivity of permafrost loss to global warming, using permafrost area from *02_CMIP6_EA_pf_area_monthly_masked.ncl* and simulated global air temperature.  

- **05_Ts_sensitivity.py**  
This routine is used to calculate the seasonal sensitivity of soil temperature, based on observational records and model-simulated soil temperature.  

- **06_ALT_sensitivity.py**  
This routine uses ALT data from *01_Alt_monthly.jl* and interpolated CMIP6 soil temperature data, estimating the ALT sensitivity on two timescales.  
  - Vertical interpolation: *08_interpolate_depth.jl*  
  - Horizontal interpolation: *09_cmip6_Ts_grid05.sh*  

- **07_Chadburn_sensitivity.ipynb**  
This routine uses the method from Chadburn et al. (2017) to assess the sensitivity of permafrost loss to global warming. For methodological details, see Chadburn et al. (2017) and the Supplementary Information of this study.  

- **08_interpolate_depth.jl**  
This routine is used to perform vertical interpolation of raw CMIP6 soil temperature data.  

- **09_cmip6_Ts_grid05.sh**  
This routine is used to perform horizontal interpolation of vertically interpolated CMIP6 soil temperature data to a 0.5° × 0.5° grid, as specified in *cmip6_Ts_grid05.txt*.

### Plot/  
The **Plot** folder contains all plotting scripts (13 Jupyter notebooks in Python) used to generate the figures presented in the manuscript.

- Each notebook is named according to the figure number in the paper.  
- Input data are obtained either from the raw datasets or from the outputs of the **Process/** folder.
